# Basic Calculator and Reversed ASCII Values

This program takes two 3-digit numbers from the user, performs basic calculator calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on these numbers, and also calculates the ASCII values of their reversed digits. The results are presented in a formatted matrix.

## Features

1. **Three-Digit Number Validation**: The program ensures that the user provides only valid 3-digit numbers. Numbers that are not 3 digits long are rejected.

2. **Basic Calculator Calculations**: The program performs basic calculator calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on the two entered 3-digit numbers.

3. **Reversed ASCII Values**: For each of the entered numbers, the program calculates the reversed ASCII values of the digits and presents the sum of these reversed ASCII values.

4. **Formatted Result Matrix**: The results are displayed in a matrix format for better readability.

## How to Use

1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. The program will prompt you to enter the first 3-digit number. If the input is valid, it will then prompt you to enter the second 3-digit number.
3. After both valid numbers are entered, the program will calculate the basic calculator results and reversed ASCII values.
4. The calculated results will be displayed in a formatted matrix.
5. The program will ask if you want to continue. If you answer 'Yes', the process will repeat for additional iterations.

## Note

- If you enter a number that is not 3 digits long, the program will prompt you to enter a valid number again.
- The program calculates the reversed ASCII values of individual digits of the numbers and presents the sum of these values.
